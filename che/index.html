            <h2>Greenhouse gas emission</h2>
            <p id="uis">Exploration of greenhouse gas emission management reveals a multifaceted<br> 
                approach to mitigating its impact. It formulates strategies geared towards<br> 
                readiness, leveraging various initiatives to curtail lossesInitiatives span<br>
                from awareness campaigns to the identification and categorization of emissions,<br>
                Emphasizing the imperative to minimize adverse effects. India's susceptibility<br>
                to these emissions is evident, as witnessed by recent events such as cyclone Jawad.<br>
                Early detection mechanisms are crucial, guiding interventions aimed at safeguarding <br>
                lives and livelihoods. This undertaking bears immense significance for the nation,<br>
                necessitating proactive measures like evacuations from high-risk zones and<br>
                resettlement efforts to ensure community safety and resilience in the<br> 
                face of such environmental challenges.</p>

        <h1 class="heading2">Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Statistics & Facts</h1>
        <p class="pa1">Greenhouse gas emissions result from various human activities and contribute to climate change. In 2022, global emissions reached record levels, with approximately X metric tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. This marked a Y% increase from the previous year, reflecting the ongoing challenge of mitigating emissions worldwide. The energy sector remains the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for Z% of total emissions. Efforts to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources have intensified in recent years, but significant challenges persist in achieving emission reduction targets set under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement.</p>
