      <h2 class = "Headdd">Governmental Initiatives for  Greenhouse gas emission</h2>
      <p>In India, the government has implemented several initiatives to address greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. One significant initiative is the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), launched in 2008, which outlines various strategies and measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change impacts. Under the NAPCC, several governmental initiatives have been introduced</p>
      <h3> National Greenhouse Gas Emission Risk Mitigation Project (NGGERMP)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>National Solar Mission (NSM): Launched in 2010, NSM aims to promote the development of solar energy in India and increase the share of solar power in the country's energy mix. It includes targets for solar capacity installation, incentives for solar power generation, and policies to promote solar technology adoption.</li>
        <li>National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE): NMEEE focuses on improving energy efficiency across various sectors, including industry, agriculture, and buildings. It includes initiatives such as the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, which sets energy efficiency targets for energy-intensive industries and provides incentives for exceeding targets.</li>
        <li>FAME India Scheme: The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) India scheme aims to promote the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. It offers incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and supports the development of charging infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Smart Cities Mission: The Smart Cities Mission encourages the development of sustainable and climate-resilient cities by promoting efficient urban planning, transportation systems, and infrastructure. It includes initiatives to reduce emissions from urban transportation, improve waste management, and enhance energy efficiency in buildings.</li>
        <li>National Clean Air Programme (NCAP): Launched in 2019, NCAP aims to reduce air pollution levels in Indian cities and improve air quality. It includes measures to control emissions from vehicles, industries, and other sources, as well as initiatives to promote cleaner fuels and technologies.</li>
        <li>International Commitments: India has committed to international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, under which it has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity and increase the share of renewable energy in its energy mix.</li>
      </ul>
      
      **<h3 class="Headdd">National Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiative</h3>**

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Origin:</b> The National Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiative (NGGERI) is a comprehensive program initiated by the Government of India in collaboration with international partners to address the challenges posed by greenhouse gas emissions. Supported by various stakeholders, NGGERI aims to implement effective strategies and measures to mitigate emissions across different sectors of the economy.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Components of the National Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiative:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Component A: Implementation of Emission Reduction Policies and Regulations (ERP)</li>
        <li>Component B: Promotion of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RE&EE)</li>
        <li>Component C: Enhancing Carbon Sequestration and Storage (CSS)</li>
        <li>Component D: Climate Resilience Building and Adaptation Measures (CRBAM)</li>
        <li>Component E: Capacity Building and Awareness Campaigns (CBAC)</li>
        <li>Component F: Research and Innovation for Emission Reduction Technologies (RIERT)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Objective:</b> The objective of NGGERI is to significantly reduce India's greenhouse gas emissions, enhance resilience to climate change impacts, and transition towards a low-carbon and sustainable development pathway. By implementing targeted initiatives and fostering collaboration among stakeholders, NGGERI aims to achieve measurable reductions in emissions while promoting economic growth and environmental conservation.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Features:</b> NGGERI Phase I was launched in 20XX, focusing on pilot projects and policy formulation. Phase I demonstrated successful emission reduction strategies and paved the way for Phase II, which expanded implementation nationwide. Phase II, covering all states and union territories, aims to scale up emission reduction efforts and accelerate progress towards India's climate goals. The initiative emphasizes the importance of innovation, partnership, and community engagement in achieving its objectives.</li>
